# epistemon
A C library for robotics

# Getting Started
Epistemon is a header only library, simply include ./epistemon and you're ready to go. 
If you define EPISTEMON_ENTRY then Epistemon will handle all the setup and control needed for a robot. 
Otherwise it will work like a regular library.

# Examples
The ./examples directory has various examples that allow to see epistemon working and explore it's capabilities. 
Just run make to build all the examples.
